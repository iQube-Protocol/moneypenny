  "overview": {
    "qripto": "Qripto is a set of Quantum-Ready Internet protocols that make data, identity, and payments agent-first and privacy-preserving. It centers on iQubes (secure information containers), Aigents (AI agents), COYN ($QOYN) for broader value flows, and QriptoCENT (Qc), a cent-pegged micro-stablecoin engineered for ultra-fine, agent-to-agent commerce."
  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What is QriptoCENT (Qc)?",
      "a": "A cent-pegged, agent-native micro-stablecoin (1 Qc = US $0.01) with sub-cent precision, designed for tiny programmable payments across media and agentic commerce."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does Qc differ from $1 stablecoins?",
      "a": "Qc prices micro-moments naturally (e.g., $0.001–$0.09), supports anti-spam tolls, and encodes splits/limits in iQubes; $1 units are too coarse for such interactions."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are iQubes?",
      "a": "Cryptographically bound containers for data, content, tools, models, and agents (5 primitives) with metaQube/BlakQube/tokenQube entanglement and fine-grained access."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is x402?",
      "a": "An agent-to-agent (A2A) standard for payments and iQube transfers, often used with DVN for cross-chain movement."
    },
    {
      "q": "Where do metaKnyts and 21 Sats fit?",
      "a": "They are the storyworld onboarding channel for the Quantum-Ready Internet; users unlock transmissions and, soon, the graphic novel using Knight COYN and Qc."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does QriptoMedia work?",
      "a": "Creators set Qc prices for unlocks/comments/DMs; x402 settles instantly; iQube policies auto-split revenue and manage access."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I move Qc across chains?",
      "a": "Yes, via DVN/x402 using canonical sends, deferred minting, or remote custody, each with different trade-offs."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is this private?",
      "a": "Yes—privacy by design with iQubes and DiDQube/KybeDID. You control what is shared."
